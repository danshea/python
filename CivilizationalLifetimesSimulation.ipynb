    "#### Simulating civilizational lifetimes\n",
    "I saw a fascinating talk by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrNu_m_9K4 which references this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12358\n",
    "\n",
    "Kipping D., Frank A., Scharf C. (2020) Contact Inequality -- First Contact Will Likely Be With An Older Civilization\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to try my hand at whipping up a small simulation of my own. I briefly describe it below. The main intent was to construct something to play with `ipycanvas` in Jupyter Lab and to also see if I could draw similar conclusions _prior_ to reading the paper just by reasoning out a quick model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I define a civilization as having a lifetime drawn from an exponential distribution scaled by 0.1 the life of the universe. \n",
    "I chose an exponential to sample lifetimes, since if we consider the death of a civilization as the expected event, we could then use an exponential to model a Poisson point process (_i.e._ - a process in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "I re-paint a civilization red to signify if it lives beyond the median lifetime of all civilizations (_i.e._ - it is \"old\").  \n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation runs for 100,000 epochs (_i.e._ - The simulated universe's lifetime) and updates the civilizations at each epoch.  \n",
    "(You can change this, along with the number of civilizations modeled, etc. in the `Simulation` class below.)\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note:_ The animation requires `ipycanvas` which may be obtained/installed by reading https://ipycanvas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a pretty neat way to add visualization to a notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "__TODO__:  \n",
    "* Try using a `MultiCanvas` to track the proportion of \"old\" civilization to \"young\". It would be nice to display this value in the upper right corner.\n",
    "* Find some time to read through the paper and compare my model to the one presented, see where I deviated and maybe perform a few runs to gather data and perform a couple more analyses."
