    "#### Introduction to Random Strings\n",
    "##### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "An array is a structure containing an ordered collection of objects (numbers, strings, other arrays, etc.). We let $A[k]$ denote the $k^{th}$ value in array $A$. You may like to think of an array as simply a matrix having only one row.\n",
    "\n",
    "A random string is constructed so that the probability of choosing each subsequent symbol is based on a fixed underlying symbol frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "GC-content offers us natural symbol frequencies for constructing random DNA strings. If the GC-content is $x$, then we set the symbol frequencies of C and G equal to $\\frac{x}{2}$ and the symbol frequencies of A and T equal to $\\frac{1-x}{2}$. For example, if the GC-content is $40\\%$, then as we construct the string, the next symbol is 'G'/'C' with probability $0.2$, and the next symbol is 'A'/'T' with probability $0.3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, many probabilities wind up being very small. In order to work with small probabilities, we may plug them into a function that \"blows them up\" for the sake of comparison. Specifically, the common logarithm of $x$ (defined for $x \\gt 0$ and denoted $log_{10}(x)$) is the exponent to which we must raise $10$ to obtain $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "See Figure 1 for a graph of the common logarithm function $y=log_{10}(x)$. In this graph, we can see that the logarithm of $x$-values between $0$ and $1$ always winds up mapping to $y$-values between $âˆ’\\inf$ and $0$: $x$-values near $0$ have logarithms close to $-\\inf$, and $x$-values close to $1$ have logarithms close to $0$. Thus, we will select the common logarithm as our function to \"blow up\" small probability values for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Given:__ A DNA string s of length at most 100 bp and an array A containing at most 20 numbers between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Return:__ An array $B$ having the same length as $A$ in which $B[k]$ represents the common logarithm of the probability that a random string constructed with the GC-content found in $A[k]$ will match $s$ exactly.\n",
