    "#### Problem\n",
    "A binary tree is a tree in which each node has degree equal to at most 3. The binary tree will be our main tool in the construction of phylogenies.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rooted tree is a tree in which one node (the root) is set aside to serve as the pinnacle of the tree. A standard graph theory exercise is to verify that for any two nodes of a tree, exactly one path connects the nodes. In a rooted tree, every node $v$ will therefore have a single parent, or the unique node $w$ such that the path from $v$ to the root contains $\\{v,w\\}$. Any other node $x$ adjacent to $v$ is called a child of $v$ because $v$ must be the parent of $x$; note that a node may have multiple children. In other words, a rooted tree possesses an ordered hierarchy from the root down to its leaves, and as a result, we may often view a rooted tree with undirected edges as a directed graph in which each edge is oriented from parent to child. We should already be familiar with this idea; it's how the Rosalind problem tree works!\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though a binary tree can include nodes having degree 2, an unrooted binary tree is defined more specifically: all internal nodes have degree 3. In turn, a rooted binary tree is such that only the root has degree 2 (all other internal nodes have degree 3).\n",

    "__Return:__ The number of internal nodes of any unrooted binary tree having $n$ leaves.\n",
