    "#### Problem\n",
    "A set is the mathematical term for a loose collection of objects, called elements. Examples of sets include $\\{$the moon, the sun, Wilford Brimley$\\}$ and $\\mathcal{R}$, the set containing all real numbers. We even have the empty set, represented by $\\emptyset$ or $\\{\\}$, which contains no elements at all. Two sets are equal when they contain the same elements. In other words, in contrast to permutations, the ordering of the elements of a set is unimportant (_e.g._ - $\\{$the moon, the sun, Wilford Brimley$\\}$ is equivalent to $\\{$Wilford Brimley, the moon, the sun$\\}$). Sets are not allowed to contain duplicate elements, so that $\\{$Wilford Brimley, the sun, the sun$\\}$ is not a set. We have already used sets of 2 elements to represent edges from a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "A set $A$ is a subset of $B$ if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$, and we write $A \\subseteq B$. For example, $\\{$the sun, the moon$\\}\\subseteq\\{$the sun, the moon, Wilford Brimley$\\}$, and $\\emptyset$ is a subset of every set (including itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "As illustrated in the biological introduction, we can use subsets to represent the collection of taxa possessing a character. However, the number of applications is endless; for example, an event in probability can now be defined as a subset of the set containing all possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first question is to count the total number of possible subsets of a given set.\n",

    "__Given:__ A positive integer n (n≤1000).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Return:__ The total number of subsets of {1,2,…,n} modulo 1,000,000.\n",
