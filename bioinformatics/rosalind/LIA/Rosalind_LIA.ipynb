    "Two events $A$ and $B$ are independent if $P(A \\land B)$ is equal to $P(A) \\times Pr(B)$. In other words, the events do not influence each other, so that we may simply calculate each of the individual probabilities separately and then multiply.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, random variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent if whenever $A$ and $B$ are respective events for $X$ and $Y$, $A$ and $B$ are independent (i.e., $P(A \\land B) = Pr(A) \\times Pr(B)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of how helpful independence can be for calculating probabilities, let $X$ and $Y$ represent the numbers showing on two six-sided dice. Intuitively, the number of pips showing on one die should not affect the number showing on the other die. If we want to find the probability that $X+Y$ is odd, then we don't need to draw a tree diagram and consider all possibilities. We simply first note that for $X+Y$ to be odd, either $X$ is even and $Y$ is odd or $X$ is odd and $Y$ is even. In terms of probability, $P((X+Y)_{odd}) = P(X_{even} \\land Y_{odd}) + P(X_{odd} \\land Y_{even})$. Using independence, this becomes $[P(X_{even}) \\times P(Y_{odd})] +[Pr(X_{odd}) \\times Pr(Y_{even})]$, or $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n",

    "#### Discussion of the solution\n",
    "The first thing to notice is that every generation always mates with heterozygous (Aa Bb) partners.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you draw out a Punnett Square, for the different genotypes of the A allele, you will see that the probability of heterozygous offspring is always $0.5$ independent of Tom's progeny's genotype.  \n",
    "\n",
    "From there, we want to determine the probability of both alleles being Heterozygous, so this is simply $0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.25$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have two important pieces of information about the problem that we can apply towards formulating a solution.\n",
    "- The prior generation's genotype does not matter\n",
    "- The probability of a double heterozygotic offspring is 0.25\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the probability of all other offspring is $1.0 - 0.25 = 0.75$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a generation $k$ we will have $2^{k}$ offspring.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we write the genotypes as 1 for double-hetero and 0 for all others, we see this can be written as a binary vector where each position in the vector is the genotype of an offspring. And all possible combinations of offspring then become a binary string with $2^k$ bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in my first approach, this means the size of the vector increases exponentially with respect to the generation. (e.g. - $k=3$ is $2^{3}$ offspring yielding a vector of $2^{3}$ bits and thus $2^{2^{3}}$ possible binary vectors representing all possible genotype combinations!)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can improve upon this if we also note the problem wants probabilities where $\\geq N$ double-hetero offspring are in the family tree at generation $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the first approach made use of coding double-hetero as $1$, the sum of the vector tells you how many double-hetero offspring are present in that outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can determine how many outcomes contain a certain number of $1$ values by noticing that this is the same as looking for the combination of $r$ number of $1$ values in a $2^{k}$ bit binary vector.\n",
