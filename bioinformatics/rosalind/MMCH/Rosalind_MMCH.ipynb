    "#### Problem\n",
    "The graph theoretical analogue of the quandary stated in the introduction above is that if we have an RNA string $s$ that does not have the same number of occurrences of 'C' as 'G' and the same number of occurrences of 'A' as 'U', then the bonding graph of $s$ cannot possibly possess a perfect matching among its basepair edges. In fact, most bonding graphs will not contain a perfect matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of this fact, we define a maximum matching in a graph as a matching containing as many edges as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "A maximum matching of basepair edges will correspond to a way of forming as many base pairs as possible in an RNA string.\n",

    "##### Solution\n",
    "First, we determine how many of each base exist in the RNA sequence.  \n",
    "We may then see that for each nucleotide pairing (_i.e._ {A,U} and {G,C}) that the possible bondings may be computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "(Using 'AUGCUUC' as our example)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 U bases and 1 A base, meaning we have 3 ways of selecting U to pair with the single A.  \n",
    "Like wise, there are 2 C bases and 1 G base, meaning we have 2 ways of selecting C to pair with G.  \n",
    "We then multiply $3 \\times 2$ to arrive at $6$ as the possible number of maximum matchings of basepair edges in the bonding graph of $s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this with a more non-trivial sequence _e.g._ - 'AUGACUUCAU'  \n",
    "\n",
    "3 Adenine and 4 Uracil $4 \\times 3 \\times 2$ (_i.e._ - 4 U's for the first A, 3 U's for the second A, 2 U's for the third A)  \n",
    "1 Guanine and 2 Cytosine $2$ (_i.e._ - 2 C's for the single G)  \n",
