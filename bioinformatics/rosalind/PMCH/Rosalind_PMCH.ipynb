    "A matching in a graph $G$ is a collection of edges of $G$ for which no node belongs to more than one edge in the collection. If $G$ contains an even number of nodes (say $2n$), then a matching on $G$ is perfect if it contains $n$ edges, which is clearly the maximum possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let $K_n$ denote the complete graph on $2n$ labeled nodes, in which every node is connected to every other node with an edge, and let $p_n$ denote the total number of perfect matchings in $K_n$. For a given node $x$, there are $2n−1$ ways to join $x$ to the other nodes in the graph, after which point we must form a perfect matching on the remaining $2n−2$ nodes. This reasoning provides us with the recurrence relation $p_{n}=(2n−1)⋅p_{n}−1$; using the fact that $p_1$ is $1$, this recurrence relation implies the closed equation $p_{n}=(2n−1)(2n−3)(2n−5)\\cdots(3)(1)$.\n",

    "Given an RNA string $s = s_{1} \\ldots s_{n}$, a bonding graph for $s$ is formed as follows. First, assign each symbol of $s$ to a node, and arrange these nodes in order around a circle, connecting them with edges called adjacency edges. Second, form all possible edges ${A, U}$ and ${C, G}$, called basepair edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a matching contained in the basepair edges will represent one possibility for base pairing interactions in $s$. For such a matching to exist, $s$ must have the same number of occurrences of 'A' as 'U' and the same number of occurrences of 'C' as 'G'.\n",
