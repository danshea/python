Description:
A first crack at implementing keypair generation and key management
Ran into the problem at previous sysadmin positions, many ways to do this
kind of thing, but I figured it would be a fun exercise.

Please NOTE:  The keypair in the log shown here are not being used by anything
It was for a sample run to test the functionality, no private keys have been
compromised. ;-)
