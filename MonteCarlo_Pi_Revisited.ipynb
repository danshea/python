    "#### Using Monte Carlo to estimate $\\pi$ revisited\n",
    "I coded this up about a decade ago in `wxpython` with a gui to illustrate the application of Monte Carlo method to approximate the value $\\pi$.  \n",
    "However, I don't think it runs anymore (as `wxpython` has changed quite a bit in the intervening years).  \n",
    "So Let's run through it again and this time we'll use `ipycanvas` to illustrate the method.  \n",
    "First, let's briefly walk through the experimental setup.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Experimental setup\n",
    "If we inscribe a unit circle inside of a unit square and begin to rnadomly throw darts at the defined area, the number of darts that land inside of the circle should roughly be in proportion to the area of the circle to the square. And the more darts we throw, the better our approximation would become.\n",
    "\n",
    "To that end, we can construct the formula as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{P_{c}}{P_{s}} = \\frac{A_{c}}{A_{s}} = \\frac{\\pi \\cdot r^{2}}{4 \\cdot r^{2}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And we know that all of the darts would land inside the square, so that is equal to the total number of darts thrown.  \n",
    "Therefore, we may re-write this to approximate $\\pi$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi \\approx 4 \\cdot \\frac{P_{c}}{P_{total}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are on a computer, we'll substitue our darts for points randomly selected from a uniform distribution spanning the coordinates of our square and see what proportion of them land inside the circle in relation to the total number of points drawn. Multiply that by 4 and see if our answer is close to the value of $\\pi$."
