Description: This git repository is a collection of various python code I have written over the years.  
It goes back at least 7 years or so now, so some code is 2.x and newer things will be 3.x.  

This repository is now fairly long in the tooth in places.  
Some of the older stuff might no longer run as some of the dependent libraries have been re-written.  
Case in point, my Monte Carlo Pi approximation made use of wxpython and displayed a rudimentary gui window to illustrate the simulation.  
I've since re-written it as a notebook that uses ipycanvas.
